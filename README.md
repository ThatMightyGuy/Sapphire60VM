# Sapphire/60

### A really weird computer.

This is an emulator of an architecture I've made up.

The intended purpose is for it to eventually become a Minecraft mod inspired by TIS-100 and TIS-3D.

I've made it to be simple yet fun to program for, by making the experience itself different enough to not feel like a day job.

## Documentation

*Sapphire/60* also differs from actual computers in the 'hardware' itself. Look at the [assembly manual](Sapphire60/Docs/asm.md) if you feel like your day is not cursed enough.

Follow [this link](Sapphire60/Docs/arch.md) for information about the architecture.

## What's next?

In order of priority.

* More preprocessor directives for the assembler. I want `.define`, `.ifdef`, `.ifndef` and `.include`
* Less restrictive assembly, allowing direct relative/absolute jumps with no need for labels, for example
* Software stack implementation
* A port of Wozmon
* \[in distant future\] MS Basic port
